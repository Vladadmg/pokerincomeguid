<p>The sign up bonuses codes that are given in the game of Poker are known as Poker bonus codes. At the time of joining a poker room, that alphanumeric code is required to get the bonus. Poker bonus codes are of two types <strong></strong></p>
<p>The sign up bonuses codes that are given in the game of Poker are known as Poker bonus codes. At the time of joining a poker room, that alphanumeric code is required to get the bonus.</p>
<p>Poker bonus codes are of two types</p>
<p>The first one is the bonus code that is used at the first money deposit in an online poker room.</p>
<p>This poker bonus code is given by the poker room to a player who has not used that Poker room before.</p>
<p>Almost all poker rooms ensure that no one gets the poker bonus code more than once, fooling the poker room by signing up again with a different user name.</p>
<p>It is better to search information about the best available poker bonus codes before making a decision to join an online poker room and making the first deposit. The poker bonus code can be used to get the free cash. Information about the different poker bonus codes of different poker room can be found by going through some “Poker Reviews” sites. There is a number of websites that offer this free information. Moreover, if a person joins a poker room from that site, it also gives additional bonus. Once a person has joined the poker room, the bonus code is accepted automatically in the poker room and the free cash is given at the time of first real cash deposit.</p>
<p>The second poker bonus code is not always given. This poker bonus code can be used when a person is already a member of that particular poker room. This poker bonus code allows the player to get free cash at the time of next money deposit. The second poker bonus code generally has some restriction. With this poker bonus code, there are restrictions on the withdrawals. Also the restrictions can be on the raked hands. The restrictions do not allow the player to withdraw free cash or it may not allow the player to withdraw cash until the player has played a specific number of required raked hands.</p>
<p>Raked hands are used for the real money games that do not involve any ‘buy-in’ and instead of a set chip amount; the player needs to take the real money to the table.</p>
<p>The poker rooms want to entice the new gambler to join their poker room. So, almost every poker room offers poker bonus codes in order to attract new gamblers every now and then. Poker rooms actually want to make sure that they stay ahead in the competition and do not want to loose new gamblers to other competitors. But there is a limitation on that poker bonus code too. Poker rooms have different maximum bonus limits. It varies from site to site.</p>
<p>So the Poker Bonus Code is a form of free money, so it’s a good thing to take.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Each poker tournament is going to offer its variables. This is regardless of whether it is the same weekly tournament, a turbo sit-and-go or a big online poker circus with thousands participating. You can&#8217;t control the cards, the other players or when there are breaks in the action.</p>
<p>The only thing you can control is how you prepare for your competition. Competitors will change, those who become regular faces (or nicknames) will probably improve and hopefully you&#8217;ll do some improvement of you own. Ultimately, you can create more consistent tournament results by preparing consistently for your tournament play.</p>
<p>Some of what follows definitely falls into the category of common sense; yet putting it into practice is easier said than done. And you need to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Tournament play requires tournament practice. That&#8217;s obvious, right? If you want to enjoy success in your <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-tournaments">online poker tournament</a> career, you have to know how to play poker in a tournament setting. Remember, a large tournament is going to feel like a slow grind sometimes.</p>
<p>You must consistently build your stack through playing solid poker without getting over anxious to eliminate others early. Remember, many bad players will eliminate themselves from the action. Once you&#8217;re in the money you can begin shifting focus towards advancing to the final table.</p>
<p>Playing a smart and aggressive <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-strategy-articles">tournament poker strategy</a> will help you continue to advance. It&#8217;s good to get into some single table sit-and-gos to help you flex your final table muscles. Once at the final table, it definitely becomes more about eliminating the other competitors rather than building your stack.</p>
<p>That being said, you&#8217;ll also know when two players are going for the gusto, and when you see that train coming, get off the track. Again, your competitors will often do the work for you; continue to play smart!</p>
<p><strong>Physical Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Many people probably don&#8217;t give much thought to how they physically prepare for a poker tournament. Partying hard the night before while racking up three hours of sleep may be typical Vegas behavior, but it&#8217;s not advisable to the online tournament player. Poker tournaments can last several hours and in some cases can go on for a day or more.</p>
<p>he last thing you want to do is show up in front of your computer with less than 100 percent of your mental capacity. A consistent sleep schedule leading up to the event (for big events) will definitely help you capitalize on your investment.</p>
<p>If you happen to play smaller daily tournaments at the <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/online-poker-rooms">online poker rooms</a>, that’s great! You probably don&#8217;t rely on a detailed preparation plan, but at the same time you can&#8217;t argue with how much better you play when well rested, with a strong energy level.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is nutrition. Your brain functions on carbohydrates. For anyone swearing by a protein only diet, don&#8217;t forget this. Snacking on something nutritious the way Jamie Gold snacked on blueberries when winning the 2006 WSOP Main Event is an excellent idea and will keep your mental motor running.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tournaments are a great way to enjoy your favorite online casino games like Blackjack and Poker. There are many online tournaments available from lots of different online casinos and great prizes too!</p>
<p>Online poker tournaments come in several varieties, the most popular being Texas Hold’Em. They usually happen daily at online casinos but often are part of a special contest or promotion with the site. Some of the most popular online casino poker tournaments are those that offer seats to one the worlds’ biggest poker tournaments: The World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the World Poker Tour Championship. Many <a href="http://www.onlinecasinos.net/"><strong>online casinos</strong></a> will offer small tournaments, satellites and sit-and-go tournaments with the grand prize being one seat at one of these events.</p>
<p>Blackjack tournaments are also extremely popular at online casinos. Most blackjack tournaments are played using the Elimination Blackjack rules – a combination of Blackjack and No Limit Texas Hold ‘Em poker, invented by Russ Hamilton, winner of the 1994 World Series of Poker main event.</p>
<p>Tournaments are great because they give players a chance to hone their skills against other players and play can be much more exciting than just playing against the house. Some online casinos offer free tournaments as well – a great way to practice before playing real money!</p>
