<p>Each poker tournament is going to offer its variables. This is regardless of whether it is the same weekly tournament, a turbo sit-and-go or a big online poker circus with thousands participating. You can&#8217;t control the cards, the other players or when there are breaks in the action.</p>
<p>The only thing you can control is how you prepare for your competition. Competitors will change, those who become regular faces (or nicknames) will probably improve and hopefully you&#8217;ll do some improvement of you own. Ultimately, you can create more consistent tournament results by preparing consistently for your tournament play.</p>
<p>Some of what follows definitely falls into the category of common sense; yet putting it into practice is easier said than done. And you need to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Tournament play requires tournament practice. That&#8217;s obvious, right? If you want to enjoy success in your <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-tournaments">online poker tournament</a> career, you have to know how to play poker in a tournament setting. Remember, a large tournament is going to feel like a slow grind sometimes.</p>
<p>You must consistently build your stack through playing solid poker without getting over anxious to eliminate others early. Remember, many bad players will eliminate themselves from the action. Once you&#8217;re in the money you can begin shifting focus towards advancing to the final table.</p>
<p>Playing a smart and aggressive <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-strategy-articles">tournament poker strategy</a> will help you continue to advance. It&#8217;s good to get into some single table sit-and-gos to help you flex your final table muscles. Once at the final table, it definitely becomes more about eliminating the other competitors rather than building your stack.</p>
<p>That being said, you&#8217;ll also know when two players are going for the gusto, and when you see that train coming, get off the track. Again, your competitors will often do the work for you; continue to play smart!</p>
<p><strong>Physical Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Many people probably don&#8217;t give much thought to how they physically prepare for a poker tournament. Partying hard the night before while racking up three hours of sleep may be typical Vegas behavior, but it&#8217;s not advisable to the online tournament player. Poker tournaments can last several hours and in some cases can go on for a day or more.</p>
<p>he last thing you want to do is show up in front of your computer with less than 100 percent of your mental capacity. A consistent sleep schedule leading up to the event (for big events) will definitely help you capitalize on your investment.</p>
<p>If you happen to play smaller daily tournaments at the <a href="http://www.pokerlistings.com/online-poker-rooms">online poker rooms</a>, that’s great! You probably don&#8217;t rely on a detailed preparation plan, but at the same time you can&#8217;t argue with how much better you play when well rested, with a strong energy level.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is nutrition. Your brain functions on carbohydrates. For anyone swearing by a protein only diet, don&#8217;t forget this. Snacking on something nutritious the way Jamie Gold snacked on blueberries when winning the 2006 WSOP Main Event is an excellent idea and will keep your mental motor running.</p></div>

					<p>Tournaments are a great way to enjoy your favorite online casino games like Blackjack and Poker. There are many online tournaments available from lots of different online casinos and great prizes too!</p>
<p>Online poker tournaments come in several varieties, the most popular being Texas Hold’Em. They usually happen daily at online casinos but often are part of a special contest or promotion with the site. Some of the most popular online casino poker tournaments are those that offer seats to one the worlds’ biggest poker tournaments: The World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the World Poker Tour Championship. Many <a href="http://www.onlinecasinos.net/"><strong>online casinos</strong></a> will offer small tournaments, satellites and sit-and-go tournaments with the grand prize being one seat at one of these events.</p>
<p>Blackjack tournaments are also extremely popular at online casinos. Most blackjack tournaments are played using the Elimination Blackjack rules – a combination of Blackjack and No Limit Texas Hold ‘Em poker, invented by Russ Hamilton, winner of the 1994 World Series of Poker main event.</p>
<p>Tournaments are great because they give players a chance to hone their skills against other players and play can be much more exciting than just playing against the house. Some online casinos offer free tournaments as well – a great way to practice before playing real money!</p>

					<p>Poker as the game today has evolved through the centuries from various games, all of which involve the basic principles of domino combinations, ranked cards and the use of bluffing as a technique. With its history spread over various locations, it has developed into a global phenomenon as it is today</p>
<p><strong>China</strong></p>
<p>A popular belief that the game originated from china dates back from 969 A.D. when it was reported that The Emperor Mu-tsung was playing domino cards with his wife on the news years eve.</p>
<p><strong>Persia</strong></p>
<p>Playing cards had already been invented for various betting games. The cards were known as Ganjifa or Treasure cards and contained around 96 cards made of paper thin slices of precious wood or ivory. The game which poker is thought of being derived directly from is the person game As Nas which used 25 cards and included rounds of betting and card rankings.</p>
<p><strong>France, Germany, Ireland and Spain</strong></p>
<p>Different variations of the game which required rounds of betting, card rankings and bluffing includes the French Poque and Germany’s Pochen, both of whom became very popular during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These games evolved from an earlier sixteenth century Spanish game called Primero which involves three cards being dealt to each player and bluffing as the main technique to play the game.</p>
<p>Since Poque was national game in France, French-Canadian settlers who found New Orleans spread the game to that side of the world. In 1834, author Jonathan H. Green makes references to poker in his writing by talking about a cheating game played on Mississippi boats. This game quickly turned into the 3 card-monte which became popular in the gambling circuit. After green wrote a document on this mysterious cheating game in his book ‘An Exposure of the Arts and Miseries of Gambling&#8217;, poker became an entity of it’s own.</p>
<p>By 1875 the European influence over the game finished after the introduction of the joker as a wild card and during the Wild West period in the United States, poker became the most popular pastime with poker tables available in every saloon in every town.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>
<p>The different variations in poker are Texas Hold ‘em, Omaha, 5 card draw, 7 card stud, manila, razz and draw poker. Of them the most popular is the Texas Hold ‘em. It is also the title variation in the World Series of Poker. The other two variations which have dominated the scene of poker is the 5 card draw, which rose in popularity after the American Civil War, and the 7 card stud, which grew widespread shortly before the Second World War.</p>
