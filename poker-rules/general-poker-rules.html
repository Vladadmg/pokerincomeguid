<p><strong>GENERAL POKER RULES</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buy-In</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> When you enter a game, you must make a full buy-in. At limit poker, a full buy-in is at least ten times the maximum bet for the game being played, unless designated otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You are allowed to make only one short buy-in for a game. Adding to your stack is not considered a buy-in, and may be done in any quantity between hands.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A player who is forced to transfer from a broken game or must-move game to a game of the same limit may continue to play the same amount of money, even if it is less than the minimum buy-in. A player switching games voluntarily must have the proper buy-in size for the new game.</p>
<p><strong>Misdeals</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The following circumstances cause a misdeal, provided attention is called to the error before two players have acted on their hands. (If two players have acted in turn, the deal must be played to conclusion, as explained in rule #2)</p>
<p>(a) The first or second card of the hand has been dealt faceup or exposed through dealer error.<br>
(b) Two or more cards have been exposed by the dealer.<br>
(c) Two or more boxed cards (improperly faced cards) are found.<br>
(d) Two or more extra cards have been dealt in the starting hands of a game.<br>
(e) An incorrect number of cards has been dealt to a player, except the top card may be dealt if it goes to the player in proper sequence.<br>
(f) Any card has been dealt out of the proper sequence (except an exposed card may be replaced by the burncard).<br>
(g) The button was out of position.<br>
(h) The first card was dealt to the wrong position.<br>
(i) Cards have been dealt to an empty seat or a player not entitled to a hand.<br>
(j) A player has been dealt out who is entitled to a hand. This player must be present at the table or have posted a blind or ante.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Once action occurs, a misdeal can no longer be declared. The hand will be played to conclusion, and no money will be returned to any player whose hand is fouled. In button games, action is considered to occur when two players after the blinds have acted on their hands. In stud games, action is considered to occur when two players after the forced bet have acted on their hands.</p>
<p><strong>Dead Hands </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Your hand is declared dead if:</p>
<p>(a) You fold or announce that you are folding when facing a bet or a raise.<br>
(b) You throw your hand away in a forward motion causing another player to act
behind you (even if not facing a bet).<br>
(c) In stud, when facing a bet, you pick your upcards off the table, turn your upcards
facedown, or mix your upcards and downcards together.
(d) The hand does not contain the proper number of cards for that particular game
(except at stud a hand missing the final card may be ruled live, and at lowball
and draw high a hand with too few cards before the draw is live).<br>
(e) You act on a hand with a joker as a holecard in a game not using a joker. (A
player who acts on a hand without looking at a card assumes the liability of
finding an improper card, as given in Irregularities, rule #8.)<br>
(f) You have the clock on you when facing a bet or raise and exceed the specified
time limit.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Cards thrown into the muck may be ruled dead. However, a hand that is clearly identifiable may be retrieved at management's discretion if doing so is in the best interest of the game. We will make an extra effort to rule a hand retrievable if it was folded as a result of incorrect information given to the player.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Cards thrown into another player's hand are dead, whether they are faceup or facedown.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Irregularities</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> In button games, if it is discovered that the button was placed incorrectly on the previous hand, the button and blinds will be corrected for the new hand in a manner that gives every player one chance for each position on the round (if possible).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You must protect your own hand at all times. Your cards may be protected with your hands, a chip, or other object placed on top of them. If you fail to protect your hand, you will have no redress if it becomes fouled or the dealer accidentally kills it.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> If a card with a different color back appears during a hand, all action is void and all chips in the pot are returned to the respective bettors. If a card with a different color back is discovered in the stub, all action stands.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If two cards of the same rank and suit are found, all action is void, and all chips in the pot are returned to the players who wagered them (subject to next rule).</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> A player who knows the deck is defective has an obligation to point this out. If such a player instead tries to win a pot by taking aggressive action (trying for a freeroll), the player may lose the right to a refund, and the chips may be required to stay in the pot for the next deal.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> If there is extra money in the pot on a deal as a result of forfeited money from the previous deal (as per rule #5), or some similar reason, only a player dealt in on the previous deal is entitled to a hand.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> A card discovered faceup in the deck (boxed card) will be treated as a meaningless scrap of paper. A card being treated as a scrap of paper will be replaced by the next card below it in the deck, except when the next card has already been dealt facedown to another player and mixed in with other downcards. In that case, the card that was faceup in the deck will be replaced after all other cards are dealt for that round.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> A joker that appears in a game where it is not used is treated as a scrap of paper. Discovery of a joker does not cause a misdeal. If the joker is discovered before a player acts on his or her hand, it is replaced as in the previous rule. If the player does not call attention to the joker before acting, then the player has a dead hand.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> If you play a hand without looking at all of your cards, you assume the liability of having an irregular card or an improper joker.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> One or more cards missing from the deck does not invalidate the results of a hand.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> Before the first round of betting, if a dealer deals one additional card, it is returned to the deck
and used as the burncard.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> Procedure for an exposed card varies with the poker form, and is given in the section for each game. A card that is flashed by a dealer is treated as an exposed card. A card that is flashed by a player will play. To obtain a ruling on whether a card was exposed and should be replaced, a player should announce that the card was flashed or exposed before looking at it. A downcard dealt off the table is an exposed card.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> If a card is exposed due to dealer error, a player does not have an option to take or reject the card. The situation will be governed by the rules for the particular game being played.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> If you drop any cards out of your hand onto the floor, you must still play them.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> If the dealer prematurely deals any cards before the betting is complete, those cards will not play, even if a player who has not acted decides to fold.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> If the dealer prematurely deals any cards before the betting is complete, those cards will not play, even if a player who has not acted decides to fold.</p>
<p><strong>Betting and Raising </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Check-raise is permitted in all games, except in certain forms of lowball.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In no-limit and pot-limit games, unlimited raising is allowed.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> In limit poker, for a pot involving three or more players who are not all-in, these limits on raises apply:</p>
<p>(a) A game with three or more betting rounds allows a maximum of a bet and three
raises.<br>
(b) A game with two betting rounds (such as lowball or draw) allows a maximum of
a bet and four raises.</p> 
<p><strong>4.</strong> Unlimited raising is allowed in heads-up play. This applies any time the action becomes heads-up before the raising has been capped. Once the raising is capped on a betting round, it cannot be uncapped by a subsequent fold that leaves two players heads-up.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> In limit play, an all-in wager of less than half a bet does not reopen the betting for any player who has already acted and is in the pot for all previous bets. A player facing less than half a bet may fold, call, or complete the wager. An all-in wager of a half a bet or more is treated as a full bet, and a player may fold, call, or make a full raise. (An example of a full raise is on a $20 betting round, raising a $15 all-in bet to $35).</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Any wager must be at least the size of the previous bet or raise in that round, unless a player is going all-in.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> The smallest chip that may be wagered in a game is the smallest chip used in the antes, blinds, rake, or collection. (Certain games may use a special rule that does not allow chips used only in house revenue to play.) Smaller chips than this do not play even in quantity, so a player wanting action on such chips must change them up between deals. If betting is in dollar units or greater, a fraction of a dollar does not play. A player going all-in must put all chips that play into the pot.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> A verbal statement denotes your action and is binding. If in turn you verbally declare a fold, check, bet, call, or raise, you are forced to take that action.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Rapping the table with your hand is a pass.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Deliberately acting out of turn will not be tolerated. A player who checks out of turn may not bet or raise on the next turn to act. An action or verbal declaration out of turn may be ruled binding if there is no bet, call, or raise by an intervening player acting after the infraction has been
committed.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> To retain the right to act, a player must stop the action by calling "time" (or an equivalent word). Failure to stop the action before three or more players have acted behind you may cause you to lose the right to act. You cannot forfeit your right to act if any player in front of you has not acted, only if you fail to act when it legally becomes your turn. Therefore, if you wait for someone whose turn comes before you, and three or more players act behind you, this still does not hinder your right to act.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> In limit poker, if you make a forward motion with chips and thus cause another player to act, you may be forced to complete your action.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> A player who bets or calls by releasing chips into the pot is bound by that action and must make the amount of the wager correct. (This also applies right before the showdown when putting chips into the pot causes the opponent to show the winning hand before the full amount needed to call has been put into the pot.) However, if you are unaware that the pot has been raised, you may withdraw that money and reconsider your action, provided that no one else has acted after you. At pot-limit or no-limit betting, if there is a gross misunderstanding concerning the amount of the wager, see <a href="no-limit-pot-limit-rules.html">No Limit and Pot-Limit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> String raises are not allowed. To protect your right to raise, you should either declare your intention verbally or place the proper amount of chips into the pot. Putting a full bet plus a halfbet or more into the pot is considered to be the same as announcing a raise, and the raise must be completed. (This does not apply in the use of a single chip of greater value.)</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> If you put a single chip in the pot that is larger than the bet, but do not announce a raise, you are assumed to have only called. Example: In a $3-$6 game, when a player bets $6 and the next player puts a $25 chip in the pot without saying anything, that player has merely called the $6 bet.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> All wagers and calls of an improperly low amount must be brought up to proper size if the error is discovered before the betting round has been completed. This includes actions such as betting a lower amount than the minimum bring-in (other than going all-in) and betting the lower limit on an upper limit betting round. If a wager is supposed to be made in a rounded off amount, is not, and must be corrected, it shall be changed to the proper amount nearest in size. No one who has acted may change a call to a raise because the wager size has been changed.</p>
<p><strong>The Showdown </strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> To win any part of a pot, a player must show all of his cards faceup on the table, whether they were used in the final hand played or not.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Cards speak (cards read for themselves). The dealer assists in reading hands, but players are
responsible for holding onto their cards until the winner is declared. Although verbal declarations
as to the contents of a hand are not binding, deliberately miscalling a hand with the intent of
causing another player to discard a winning hand is unethical and may result in forfeiture of the
pot. (For more information on miscalling a hand see <a href="lowball-rules.html">Lowball</a> Rule 15 and Rule 16.)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Any player, dealer, or floorperson who sees an incorrect amount of chips put into the pot, or an error about to be made in awarding a pot, has an ethical obligation to point out the error. Please help us keep mistakes of this nature to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> All losing hands will be killed by the dealer before a pot is awarded.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Any player who has been dealt in may request to see any hand that has been called, even if the opponent's hand or the winning hand has been mucked. However, this is a privilege that may be revoked if abused. If a player other than the pot winner asks to see a hand that has been folded, that hand is dead. If the winning player asks to see a losing player's hand, both hands are live, and the best hand wins.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Show one, show all. Players are entitled to receive equal access to information about the contents of another player's hand. After a deal, if cards are shown to another player, every player at the table has a right to see those cards. During a deal, cards that were shown to an active player who might have a further wagering decision on that betting round must immediately be shown to all the other players. If the player who saw the cards is not involved in the deal, or cannot use the information in wagering, the information should be withheld until the betting is over, so it does not affect the normal outcome of the deal. Cards shown to a person who has no more wagering decisions on that betting round, but might use the information on a later betting round, should be shown to the other players at the conclusion of that betting round. If only a portion of the hand has been shown, there is no requirement to show any of the unseen cards. The shown cards are treated as given in the preceding part of this rule.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If everyone checks (or is all-in) on the final betting round, the player who acted first is the first to show the hand. If there is wagering on the final betting round, the last player to take aggressive action by a bet or raise is the first to show the hand. In order to speed up the game, a player holding a probable winner is encouraged to show the hand without delay. If there is a side pot, players involved in the side pot should show their hands before anyone who is all-in for only the main pot.</p>
<p><strong>Ties</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The ranking of suits from highest to lowest is spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. Suits never break a tie for winning a pot. Suits are used to break a tie between cards of the same rank (no redeal or redraw).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Dealing a card to each player is used to determine things like who moves to another table. If the cards are dealt, the order is clockwise starting with the first player on the dealer's left (the button position is irrelevant). Drawing a card is used to determine things like who gets the button in a new game, or seating order coming from a broken game.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> An odd chip will be broken down to the smallest unit used in the game.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> No player may receive more than one odd chip.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> If two or more hands tie, an odd chip will be awarded as follows:</p>
<p>(a) In a button game, the first hand clockwise from the button gets the odd chip.<br>
(b) In a stud game, the odd chip will be given to the highest card by suit in all high games, and to the lowest card by suit in all low games. (When making this determination, all cards are used, not just the five cards that constitute the player's hand.)<br>
(c) In high-low split games, the high hand receives the odd chip in a split between
the high and the low hands. The odd chip between tied high hands is awarded as
in a high game of that poker form, and the odd chip between tied low hands is
awarded as in a low game of that poker form. If two players have identical hands,
the pot will be split as evenly as possible.<br>
(d) All side pots and the main pot will be split as separate pots, not mixed together.</p>
<p><strong><a name="buttonblinduse" id="buttonblinduse"></a>Button and Blind Use </strong></p>
<p>In button games, a non-playing dealer normally does the actual dealing. A round disk called the button is used to indicate which player has the dealer position. The player with the button is last to receive cards on the initial deal and has the right of last action after the first betting round. The button moves clockwise after a deal ends to rotate the advantage of last action.</p>
<p>One or more blind bets are usually used to stimulate action and initiate play. Blinds are posted before the players look at their cards. Blinds are part of a player's bet, unless the structure of a game or the situation requires part or all of a particular blind to be "dead." Dead chips are not part of a player's bet. With two blinds, the small blind is posted by the player immediately clockwise from the button, and the big blind is posted by the player two positions clockwise from the button. With more than two blinds, the little blind is normally left of the button (not on it). Action is initiated on the first betting round by the first player to the left of the blinds. On all subsequent betting rounds, the action begins with the first active player to the left of the button.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for Using Blinds</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The minimum bring-in and allowable raise sizes for the opener are specified by the poker form used and blind amounts set for a game. They remain the same even when the player in the blind does not have enough chips to post the full amount.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Each round every player must get an opportunity for the button, and meet the total amount of the blind obligations. Either of the following methods of button and blind placement may be designated to do this:</p>
<p>(a) Moving button - The button always moves forward to the next player and the blinds
adjust accordingly. There may be more than one big blind.<br>
(b) Dead button - The big blind is posted by the player due for it, and the small blind and
button are positioned accordingly, even if this means the small blind or the button is
placed in front of an empty seat, giving the same player the privilege of last action on
consecutive hands.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A player posting a blind in the game's regular structure has the option of raising the pot at the first turn to act. Although chips posted by the big blind are considered a bet, this option to raise is retained if someone goes all-in with a wager of less than the minimum raise.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> In heads-up play with two blinds, the small blind is on the button.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> A new player entering the game has the following options:</p>
<p>(a) Wait for the big blind.<br>
(b) Post an amount equal to the big blind and immediately be dealt a hand. (In lowball, a new player must either post an amount double the big blind or wait for the big blind.)</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> A new player who elects to let the button go by once without posting is not treated as a player in the game who has missed a blind, and needs to post only the big blind when entering the game.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> A person playing over is considered a new player, and must post the amount of the big blind or wait for the big blind.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> A new player cannot be dealt in between the big blind and the button. Blinds may not be made up between the big blind and the button. You must wait until the button passes.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> When you post the big blind, it serves as your opening bet. When it is your next turn to act, you have the option to raise.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> A player who misses any or all blinds can resume play by either posting all the blinds missed or waiting for the big blind. If you choose to post the total amount of the blinds, an amount up to the size of the minimum opening bet is live. The remainder is taken by the dealer to the center of the pot and is not part of your bet. When it is your next turn to act, you have the option to raise.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> If a player who owes a blind (as a result of a missed blind) is dealt in without posting, the hand is dead if the player looks at it before putting up the required chips, and has not yet acted. If the player acts on the hand and plays it, putting chips into the pot before the error is discovered, the hand is live, and the player is required to post on the next deal.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> A player who goes all-in and loses is obligated to make up the blinds if they are missed before a rebuy is made. (The person is not treated as a new player when reentering.)</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> These rules about blinds apply to a newly started game:</p>
<p>(a) Any player who drew for the button is considered active in the game and is
required to make up any missed blinds.<br />
 (b) A new player will not be required to post a blind until the button has made one
complete revolution around the table, provided a blind has not yet passed that
seat.<br />
 (c) A player may change seats without penalty, provided a blind has not yet passed
the new seat.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> In all multiple-blind games, a player who changes seats will be dealt in on the first available hand in the same relative position. Example: If you move two active positions away from the big blind, you must wait two hands before being dealt in again. If you move closer to the big blind, you can be dealt in without any penalty. If you do not wish to wait and have not yet missed a blind, then you can post an amount equal to the big blind and receive a hand. (Exception: At lowball you must kill the pot, wait for the same relative position, or wait for the big blind; <a href="lowball-rules.html">see Lowball</a>, rule #7.)</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> A player who "deals off" (by playing the button and then immediately getting up to change seats) can allow the blinds to pass the new seat one time and reenter the game behind the button without having to post a blind.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> A live "straddle bet" is not allowed at limit poker except in specified games.</p>
